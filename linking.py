#%%
# It is pretty stupid, but we have to modify the ExchangeLinker function
# We need to first copy the Linker function from bw2io. Then, we need to adapt the default fields of the 'parse_field' function within the Linker function
# Why do we need to do that? Well, Brightway currently (!! it might change in the future) sets default parameters.
# That means, when linking fields are per default first written to lowercase and stripped and special characters are removed
# HOWEVER, we want to control that by using our parameters CASE_INSENSITIVE, STRIP, REMOVE_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS.
# In order to work properly, we therefore use our values in the 'parse_field' function and set those as a default.
